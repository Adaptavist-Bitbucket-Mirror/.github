## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

This virtual organization contains mirrored repositories from [Adaptavist's Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/Adaptavist/).
It is not affiliated with Adapavist.

Mirroring simplifies tracking changes made by Adaptavist. Especially increasing version of the `scriptrunner-parent-pom` for new versions of the [ScriptRunner Plugin](https://marketplace.atlassian.com/apps/6820/scriptrunner-for-jira?hosting=datacenter&tab=versions).

The mirrored repositories allow:
- GitHub forking.
- Using GitHub Actions.
- Getting daily updates.
- Sending notifications when Adaptavist commits new changes on Bitbucket.
